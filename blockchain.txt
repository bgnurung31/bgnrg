Hello guys, nice to be part of this forum.
First, I'm an ivestor in crypto, not a trader. A few weeks ago, I tried to research some undervalue/underrated crypto project that I thnik will be a strong project in the future. I have selected it to be 4 project, that is,

1. VeChain 

2. GoChain 

3. LTO Network 

4. Fantom

I'm sure these projects will be very useful in the future.

Let's take some effort to read their whitepaper

VeChain: https://www.vechain.org/whitepaper/#bit_65sv8  

GoChain: https://www.allcryptowhitepapers.com/gochain-whitepaper/ 

LTO Network: https://ltonetwork.com/documents/LTO%20Network%20-%20Technical%20Paper.pdf 

Fantom: https://fantom.foundation/research/wp_fantom_v1.6.pdf



When I was asked, is project X good? it is not easy to decide whether a project is good or not. There are long thought processes. But in crypto, thinking too long isn't good either. But at the end of the day, adjust to your risk profile and funds.
